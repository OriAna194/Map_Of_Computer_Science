# **Obsidian Computer Science Map Instructions**

Welcome to the Computer Science Map! This guide will help you navigate through the categories and nodes efficiently using Obsidian. Each main category is represented as a node, and each node contains six sub-categories.

## **Getting Started**

You can chose from main branches as:
[[Computer Science]]
[[UVT]]
[[Global]]

from there you can chose any category of Computer Science.

Each Category has 6 sub-categories as:
[[Artificial intelligence]]  has :
- [[General(AI)]]
- [[Problems(AI)]]
- [[(Contact) AI]]
- [[Universities(AI)]]
- [[Future Predictions(AI]]
- [[Important people & journals(AI)]]


other technical instructions:
### **1. Navigate the Graph View**

- In the left sidebar, click on the **Graph View** icon to open the interactive map of your notes.
- This view displays all categories (nodes) and their connections (links).

## **Exploring the Map**

### **2. Main Categories (Nodes)**

- Each main category in your computer science map is a node. These might include categories like **Programming Languages**, **Algorithms**, **Data Structures**, **Computer Architecture**, **Databases**, and **Software Engineering**.
- Click on any node to see its connected sub-categories.

### **3. Sub-Categories**

- Each node has six sub-categories linked to it.
- For example, if you click on the **Algorithms** node, you might see sub-categories like **Sorting Algorithms**, **Search Algorithms**, **Graph Algorithms**, **Dynamic Programming**, **Greedy Algorithms**, and **Backtracking**.
- Click on any of these sub-categories to view detailed notes.

### **4. Using Links**

- Inside each note, you'll find links to other related notes. These links are clickable and will take you directly to the referenced note.
- For instance, within the **Sorting Algorithms** note, you might find links to **Quick Sort**, **Merge Sort**, and **Heap Sort**.

## **Navigating Through Links**

### **5. Back and Forward Navigation**

- Use the back and forward navigation buttons at the top-left of Obsidian to move between notes you've viewed.
- This helps you return to previous notes without losing your place.

### **6. Breadcrumb Trail**

- Enable the breadcrumb plugin from the settings for easier navigation.
- This will show you a trail of notes you’ve navigated through, allowing quick access back to parent categories or related notes.

### **7. Search Functionality**

- Use the search bar (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + F) to quickly find notes.
- You can search by keywords, tags, or note titles.

## **Technical Details**

### **8. Linking Notes**

- To create a link to another note, type `[[Note Title]]`.
- Obsidian will autocomplete note titles as you type, making linking quick and easy.

### **9. Embedding Notes**

- To embed content from one note into another, use the syntax `![[Note Title]]`.
- This is useful for viewing related information without navigating away from the current note.

### **10. Tags and Metadata**

- Add tags to your notes for better organization. Tags are written as `#tagname`.
- Use YAML front matter (the section between `---` at the top of a note) to add metadata like categories, dates, and authors.

### **11. Customizing Graph View**

- Adjust the graph view settings (found in the graph view pane) to better visualize your map. You can filter nodes, adjust link visibility, and customize the appearance.

## **Tips for Efficient Use**

### **12. Hotkeys**

- Familiarize yourself with Obsidian hotkeys to speed up your workflow. You can customize these in the settings.
- Common hotkeys include `Ctrl/Cmd + O` to open a note, `Ctrl/Cmd + E` to edit a note, and `Ctrl/Cmd + P` to open command palette.

### **13. Templates**

- Use templates for consistent note-taking. Create a template for your categories and sub-categories to ensure uniform structure.

### **14. Daily Notes**

- Utilize the daily notes feature to jot down daily learnings or tasks. This helps in keeping track of your study progress.

## **Conclusion**

Navigating the Computer Science Map in Obsidian is straightforward once you get the hang of linking and exploring notes. Use these instructions to efficiently move through categories and sub-categories, leveraging Obsidian’s powerful linking and graph visualization features. Happy studying!
