System administrators must have a strong understanding of computer hardware, software, and networks. They often need to write scripts in languages like PowerShell, Bash, or Python to automate routine tasks. While not always required to code extensively, understanding programming concepts can be beneficial.

For those interested in a career in system administration, practical experience, whether through hands-on training, educational programs, or certifications, is crucial for developing the necessary skills and competencies.
