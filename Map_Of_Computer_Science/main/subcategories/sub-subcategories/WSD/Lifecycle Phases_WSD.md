A web service design typically goes through several phases:

-  Requirements gathering to understand business needs.
-  Analysis to refine and conceptualize the service. 
-  Design to detail the service architecture and interfaces.
-  Coding and implementation of the service.
-  Testing to ensure functionality and interoperability.
-  Deployment into a live environment.
