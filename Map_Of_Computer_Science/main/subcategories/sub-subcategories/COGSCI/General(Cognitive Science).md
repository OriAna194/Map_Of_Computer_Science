Cognitive science in education is a growing field focusing on how we acquire and retain knowledge. It integrates insights from psychology, neuroscience, and pedagogy to optimize teaching strategies and improve learning outcomes. The Education Endowment Foundation has conducted a systematic review on this topic, highlighting how cognitive science approaches can be applied in classroom settings to enhance educational practices. This involves understanding key cognitive processes and designing instructional methods that align with how the brain processes and stores information (https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/education-evidence/evidence-reviews/cognitive-science-approaches-in-the-classroom).
