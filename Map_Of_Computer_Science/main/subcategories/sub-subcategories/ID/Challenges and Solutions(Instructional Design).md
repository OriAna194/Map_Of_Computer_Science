Managing Change and Resistance: Dealing with resistance to change and overcoming obstacles to adoption of new instructional methods or technologies.
Communicate the benefits and rationale for change effectively to stakeholders, and involve them in the decision-making process to build buy-in and support. Provide training, professional development opportunities, and incentives to encourage adoption of new instructional practices and technologies.
By proactively addressing these challenges and implementing effective solutions, instructional designers can create high-quality learning experiences that engage learners, facilitate knowledge acquisition, and achieve desired learning outcomes.
