Key practices in data security include ensuring data resilience to recover from breaches, implementing comprehensive data protection tools for monitoring and compliance, and using data masking to protect sensitive information during processing. In Romania, entities like the Romanian Intelligence Service and national cybersecurity strategies play significant roles in shaping system security and privacy. These institutions help define and enforce policies and standards that protect data and privacy across various sectors. For global contributions, entities such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the United States play a pivotal role by developing and disseminating security standards and practices like the NIST SP 800-53, which provides a comprehensive set of security and privacy controls for federal information systems and organizations. The field of system security and privacy is vast and continuously evolving as new technologies emerge and become integrated into everyday business practices. Ensuring effective security and privacy requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses technical measures, organizational policies, and ongoing vigilance.
