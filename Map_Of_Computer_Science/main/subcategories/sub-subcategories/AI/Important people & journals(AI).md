Important figures in AI include [[Geoffrey Hinton]], known for his work in deep learning, [[Marvin Minsky]], a pioneer in AI research, and [[John McCarthy]], often recognized as one of the fathers of AI. Each has contributed significantly to the field with their research and projects (https://www.britannica.com/technology/artificial-intelligence).

Prestigious journals and conferences such as the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), and the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) serve as vital venues for sharing knowledge and breakthroughs within the AI community (https://www.springer.com/series/13900) (https://www.britannica.com/technology/artificial-intelligence).
