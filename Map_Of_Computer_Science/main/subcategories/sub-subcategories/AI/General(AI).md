Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an expansive field that encapsulates various subcategories like theory, experimentation, and design. It covers numerous aspects from machine learning to robotics, all aiming to create systems capable of tasks requiring human intelligence. Key areas within AI include knowledge representation, automated reasoning, planning, cognition, machine learning, natural language processing, and robotics. Some challenges AI faces are ethical considerations, transparency, and explainability of AI decisions, as well as issues like bias and fairness in AI systems (https://www.springer.com/series/13900) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_artificial_intelligence).
