Computational science involves the development and use of mathematical models, simulations, and computer algorithms to solve complex scientific and engineering problems. This interdisciplinary field leverages advanced computing technology to analyze and model phenomena that are difficult or impossible to study experimentally. Computational science plays a critical role in various domains, including physics, chemistry, biology, climate science, and engineering, enabling detailed simulations and predictions that enhance our understanding of natural and engineered systems​ ​Wikipedia​​ ​IEEE Xplore​​ ​MIT CSAIL​.
