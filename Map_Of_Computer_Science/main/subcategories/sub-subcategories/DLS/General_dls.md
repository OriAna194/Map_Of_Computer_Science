The Digital Library is the collection of services and the collection of information objects and their organization, structure, and presentation that supports users in dealing with information objects available directly or indirectly via electronic/digital means.

Among the most noteworthy of these digital libraries are the [Project Gutenberg](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/project-gutenberg "Learn more about Project Gutenberg from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), the World Digital Library and the Europeana Library. The World Digital Library was created by the U.S. [Library of Congress](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/library-of-congress "Learn more about Library of Congress from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and inaugurated on 21 April 2009; the Europeana digital library, inaugurated on 20 November 2008, is an open access library that serves Europe. There are [digital library projects](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/digital-library-project "Learn more about digital library projects from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") sponsored by national libraries, among which the Miguel de Cervantes Digital Library [Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes] of the Biblioteca Nacional de España, the Gallica digital library of the Bibliothèque Nationale de France and other such projects stand out. The contents of these libraries are fundamentally works in the public domain. Though national legislation may vary, a work is typically considered to be in the public domain 70 years after the death of the author. As a result of this lack of international consensus, there are countries where works can be in the public domain only 50 years after the author's death, which explains how in one country an author's works may be freely available while in another they are not.
