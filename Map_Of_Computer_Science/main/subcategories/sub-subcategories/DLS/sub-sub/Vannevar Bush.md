(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vannevar_Bush "Vannevar Bush") and [J.C.R. Licklider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._C._R._Licklider "J. C. R. Licklider") are two contributors that advanced this idea into then current technology. Bush had supported research that led to the bomb that was dropped on [Hiroshima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima "Hiroshima"). After seeing the disaster, he wanted to create a machine that would show how technology can lead to understanding instead of destruction. This machine would include a desk with two screens, switches and buttons, and a keyboard.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_library#cite_note-6) He named this the "[Memex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex "Memex")". This way individuals would be able to access stored books and files at a rapid speed. In 1956, [Ford Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Foundation "Ford Foundation") funded Licklider to analyze how libraries could be improved with technology. Almost a decade later, his book entitled "_Libraries of the Future_" included his vision. He wanted to create a system that would use computers and networks so human knowledge would be accessible for human needs and feedback would be automatic for machine purposes. This system contained three components, the corpus of knowledge, the question, and the answer. Licklider called it a procognitive system.
