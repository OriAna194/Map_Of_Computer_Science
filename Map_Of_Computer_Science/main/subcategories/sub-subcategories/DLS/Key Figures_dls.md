The early history of digital libraries is not well documented, but several key thinkers are connected to the emergence of the concept.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_library#cite_note-3) Predecessors include [Paul Otlet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Otlet "Paul Otlet") and [Henri La Fontaine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_La_Fontaine "Henri La Fontaine")'s [Mundaneum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mundaneum "Mundaneum"), an attempt begun in 1895 to gather and systematically catalogue the world's knowledge, with the hope of bringing about world peace.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_library#cite_note-4) The visions of the digital library were largely realized a century later during the great expansion of the Internet.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_library#cite_note-5)

In 1980 the role of the library in an electronic society was the focus of a clinic on library applications of [data processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_processing "Data processing"). Participants included [Frederick Wilfrid Lancaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Wilfrid_Lancaster "Frederick Wilfrid Lancaster"), [Derek De Solla Price](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_De_Solla_Price "Derek De Solla Price"), [Gerard Salton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerard_Salton "Gerard Salton"), and [Michael Gorman)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Gorman_(librarian) "Michael Gorman (librarian)").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_library#cite_note-7)

Early projects centered on the creation of an electronic card catalogue known as [Online Public Access Catalog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Public_Access_Catalog "Online Public Access Catalog") (OPAC). By the 1980s, the success of these endeavors resulted in OPAC replacing the traditional [card catalog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_catalog "Card catalog") in many academic, public and special libraries. This permitted libraries to undertake additional rewarding co-operative efforts to support resource sharing and expand access to library materials beyond an individual library.

An early example of a digital library is the [Education Resources Information Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_Resources_Information_Center "Education Resources Information Center") (ERIC), a database of education citations, abstracts and texts that was created in 1964 and made available online through [DIALOG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIALOG "DIALOG") in 1969.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_library#cite_note-8)
