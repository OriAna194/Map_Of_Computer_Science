One of the primary challenges in software architecture is managing the complexity of systems as they scale. Solutions include employing architectural patterns like microservices, which allow for better scalability and maintainability by decomposing an application into smaller, loosely coupled services. Other patterns like monolithic architecture or layered designs each serve different project needs, emphasizing the importance of choosing the right architecture to match the system requirements and team capabilities.
