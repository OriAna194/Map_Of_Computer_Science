Scientific Computing, or Computational Science, leverages advanced computing capabilities to solve complex physical problems across various domains, including physical sciences, engineering, and economics. It integrates numerical algorithms, mathematical models, and computational models, and is crucial where traditional experimental or theoretical methods fall short due to feasibility or safety concerns.
