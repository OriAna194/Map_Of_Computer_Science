Globally, bioinformatics is a discipline offered at many universities, reflecting its integral role in biological research and its applications in areas like genomics, pharmacogenomics, and personalized medicine (https://www.britannica.com/science/bioinformatics). 

In the field of bioinformatics within Romania, significant contributions have been made by the Department of Bioinformatics & Structural Biochemistry at the Institute of Biochemistry of the Romanian Academy. Established in 1999 by Andrei-José Petrescu, the department focuses on implementing computational biology techniques to guide experimental research in molecular biology and biochemistry. The department has been recognized for its achievements with several Romanian Academy Awards and continues to impact the field with developments in structural bioinformatics, molecular modeling, and simulation techniques.

Research groups within the department are led by renowned experts. For instance, Laurentiu Spiridon brought in new computational methods for free-energy calculations used in ligand screening and drug design after returning from postdoctoral work at the Illinois Institute of Technology. Additionally, the Systems Biology of Aging Group, headed by Robi Tacutu, is leveraging bioinformatics tools and omics data to gain a better understanding of the aging process and related diseases. This group's work showcases a multidisciplinary approach, blending gerontology, bioinformatics, and machine learning.
