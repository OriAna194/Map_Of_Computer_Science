Some of the critical problems in bioinformatics include the management of vast amounts of data produced by high-throughput technologies, the need for robust algorithms for genome assembly, and challenges in annotating and interpreting genetic information. The field is actively engaged in developing solutions to these problems, such as improved software for sequence analysis and the application of machine learning techniques (https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/50934).
