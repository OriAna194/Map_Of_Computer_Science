Important people in the field include George Bell, who initiated the collection of DNA sequences, and Walter Goad, who was instrumental in developing GenBank. Bioinformatics has also been greatly influenced by the work of Arthur M. Lesk, a professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (https://www.britannica.com/science/bioinformatics).

Prominent venues for the dissemination of bioinformatics research include the journal 'Bioinformatics' published by Oxford Academic, which presents cutting-edge findings and reviews on various topics within the field (https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/).
