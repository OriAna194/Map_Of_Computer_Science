### The Future of Bioinformatics Will Include Single-Molecule Protein Sequencing Analysis

Keeping with the theme of understanding things on a granular level, single-molecule protein sequencing analysis is a possible new trend to watch out for in bioinformatics in 2025. A few single-molecule protein sequencing techniques have been developed in the last few years and 2025 may well be the year they really take off. Two particular technologies to look out for are fluorosequencing1 and single-molecule protein sequencing on semiconductor devices2. If you wish to learn more about single-molecule protein sequencing, we recommend [this Nature article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00178-y) as a starting point.
