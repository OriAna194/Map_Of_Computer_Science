Our team are increasingly participating in spatial transcriptomics discussions with clients, putting this profiling method firmly on their radar. Presently, public spatial transcriptomics data sets are few and far between. However, our bioinformaticians predict that this will change in 2023. They expect more companies and institutions will invest in spatial genomics data generation technologies this year. In turn, this will lead to an increase in publicly available spatial transcriptomics data sets over the next 12 months.

As spatial profiling becomes more popular, some of our bioinformaticians suggest we will see more methods being developed in this area. One suggestion was that more high throughput methods will be developed for spatial profiling in proteomics in particular.
